Why you will never win Roulette

In Roulette, there is a common misconception that you can statistically make an educated prediction of the next outcome given the precurring rolls. Common techniques include "Riding the trend" or through following the concept of Mean Reversion. This is why casinos include a Scoreboard. To psychologically influence the betters decisions. This is a mistake because each roll is an independent occurrence. The previous scores do not bear any weight of the future scores. In this notebook, I show you what would happen if you employed any of these "strategies". Would you have an edge and accumulate positive EV?
